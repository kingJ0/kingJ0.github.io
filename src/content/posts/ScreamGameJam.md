These assets were created for a game submitted to the [SCREAM JAM 2025](https://itch.io/jam/scream-jam-2025).

I was tasked with creating assets for a Korean-concept horror mystery game, specifically Korean-style buildings and the interior/exterior of a police station.

I created two types of building textures, road tiles, and the interior and exterior of the police station.
